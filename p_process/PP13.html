	<h1>User Scenario Mapping</h1>
        <p>Celeste is college student who is taking seven classes. Because she is taking so many classes, she does not know what to do to keep up with all of her assignments and keep them organized. One day while Celeste was taking a break from her assignments, as she was scrolling through Instagram, she saw this girl post something. In the background, there was a stationery set of notebooks and folders that caught her attention. Luckily, the girl who had posted this photo tagged the user of the creator of those stationery sets. Celeste clicks on the user and it takes her to Papeterie, a stationery website. The stationery sets are perfect for Celeste to keep all of her work organized and stay on track!</p>
